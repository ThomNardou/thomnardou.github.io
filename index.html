            <p>
                My name is Thomas Nardou, and I'm currently an apprentice developer in Switzerland. 
                My passion for the world of computing is reflected in my constant commitment to explore the many facets of programming. 
                As a fervent advocate of digital creativity, I also thrive in the field of graphic design, transforming ideas into captivating visuals. 
                I'm also an avid fan of the video game minecraft.
